# chip-8-rs

## **Motivation**

This is an attempt to develop a simple Chip-8 emulator/interpreter in Rust. I'm using this project to learn Rust because I'm really interested in what the language has to offer.

## **Usage**

`cargo run -- <path-to-chip-8-program>`

## **Programs**

There is a list of programs that I find interesting in the `programs` directory for your usage.
